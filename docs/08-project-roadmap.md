# Project Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è

This document outlines planned and potential future features for Kindler. The roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback and project priorities.

## Planned & Potential Features üí°

- **Support for different Amazon regional domains**  
  Enable scraping highlights from non-US Amazon Kindle accounts (e.g., .co.uk, .de, .jp).

- **More robust error handling and retries**  
  Improve reliability by handling network issues, timeouts, and unexpected responses gracefully.

- **Alternative export formats**  
  Add support for exporting highlights in formats such as CSV and Markdown, in addition to JSON.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
  Develop a user-friendly GUI to complement or replace the current command-line interface.

- **Automated CAPTCHA solving**  
  Investigate solutions for handling CAPTCHAs automatically. (Note: This is complex and may violate Amazon‚Äôs Terms of Service.)

- **Direct Kindle device communication**  
  Explore the possibility of reading highlights directly from Kindle devices. Kindles store a `My Clippings.txt` file that stores all highlights and notes. Cross-referencing these with existing highlights might be worthwhile.
