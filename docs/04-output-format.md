# Output Format Guide üìÅ

Kindler exports all scraped Kindle highlights and notes into a single JSON file named `highlights.json`. This file is created in the root directory of the project. If the file already exists from a previous run, it will be overwritten.

## File Structure üìù

The `highlights.json` file contains a single JSON array. Each element in this array is an object representing a book found in your Kindle Notebook.

```json
[

  {
    "asin": "EXAMPLEASIN1",
    "title": "The Great Gatsby",
    "subtitle": null, // Can be a string if a subtitle exists, or null
    "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    "coverImage": "https://example.com/gatsby.jpg",
    "dateAdded": "Monday January 1, 2024",
    "highlights": [
